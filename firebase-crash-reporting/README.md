# Description

This project is a sample app for Firebase Crash Reporting.

Crash Reporting creates detailed reports of the errors in your app.  
Errors are grouped into clusters of similar stack traces and triaged by the severity of impact on your users.  
In addition to automatic reports, you can log custom events to help capture the steps leading up to a crash.

# Required

You need to create a Firebase project, and download a ```google-services.json``` flie.
After downloading the ```google-services.json```, copy this into your project's module folder, typically ```app/```.
