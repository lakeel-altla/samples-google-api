# Description

A sample for Nearby Messages.  

The Nearby Messages API is a publish-subscribe API that lets you pass small binary payloads between internet-connected Android and iOS devices.  
The devices don't have to be on the same network, but they do have to be connected to the Internet.

By using the API, you can get the attachment data of the beacon.
